### Optical Character Recognition Notation Application

##### Things To Focus On Next:
* Character Segmentation (see http://www.cse.sc.edu/~songwang/document/wacv13c.pdf)
* Detecting Overlapping Lines (The tail on a "y" encroaches on the line below)
* Corrective GUI (Shows where program detected a line/character and allows user to adjust boundaries)
* Application Options (Menu bar with options menu)
* Analysis Of Isolated Characters (Combination of MPEG7 Edge Histogram and PHOG feature analysis/detection)
* Implementation Of Recognition Neural Net (WEKA API)
